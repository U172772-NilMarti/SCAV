This task is divided in 6 Tasks. You can select the task that you want to execute
by pressing the corresponding number on your keyboard, i.e if you want task 1 press nº1, etc.
All the code and pictures used are uploaded. Of course you can use your own.

To run the code you only have to change the input and output image directories to your own directories.
The libraries that I have used, and you need to install to compile the project are: 

-ffmpeg

-subprocess

-struct

-pynput import keyboard

-numpy as np

-scipy.fftpack import dct, idct

-matplotlib.pyplot as plt

-PIL import Image
