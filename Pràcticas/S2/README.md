----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This task is divided in 5 Tasks. You can select the task that you want to execute
by pressing the corresponding number on your keyboard, i.e if you want task 1 press nº1, etc.
All the code and pictures used are uploaded. Of course you can use your own.

To run the code you only have to change the input and output image directories to your own directories.
Useful Information:

TASK4(): impossible to download subtitles and videos online (youtube). I have tried with all my might but it has not been possible, the code is always broken.

The first and last task, the code has been taken from the ffmpeg page directly, since it is also Petava. I attach the links.

The other bars do what the statement asks.



The libraries that I have used, and you need to install to compile the project are, because if we want to use functions from the previous lab they are necessary!:

-import subprocess
-from pynput import keyboard
-import json
-import YUV
-import subtitles
